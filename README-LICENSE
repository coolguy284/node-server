Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: the files in the "modjs" folder are either direct copies or derivative works of files from elsewhere, so the repo-wide MIT+Unlicense license does not apply.
  "modjs/b64*" files: license is http://www.webtoolkit.info/license1/index.html.
  other files: also have a separate license.
