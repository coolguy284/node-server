Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: the files in the "modjs" folder are either direct copies or derivative
works of files from elsewhere, so the repo-wide MIT+Unlicense license does
not apply.
  "modjs/b64*" files: license is http://www.webtoolkit.info/license1/index.html.
  other files: also have a separate license.

Note: some of the files/folders in the "websites/js" folder are from elsewhere
and thus have their own licenses, and do not follow the MIT+Unlicense of
the rest of the repository. Folders and files that are from elsewhere and
thus have their own licenses:
  folders:
  "ace",
  files:
  "base64.js",
  "bbcode-config.js",
  "bbcode-parser.js",
  "buffer.js",
  "crypto-js-aes-3.1.2.js",
  "js.cookie-2.min.js",
  "math-5.10.3.min.js",
  "processing-1.4.8.min.js",
  "qrcodegen.js",
  "rsa.js",
  "sha256.js",
