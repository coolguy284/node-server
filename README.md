coolguy284.com: A collection of random stuff. It is a website with some utilities such as Base64 encoding and AES encryption (inside the Tools section), an advanced calculator with support for matrices, complex numbers, and transfinite numbers, and some miscellaneous stuff such as a chat and view counter.\

This is an old version of my website, its successor is https://github.com/coolguy284/node-server-new, but it is old also, and the latest version is at https://github.com/coolguy284/c284-webmain-1.
